  <div class=styledP>
  I am a <span class="bold">React</span> developer from Reading, UK. I create React
  web apps based on components styled in <br />
  <span class="bold">styled-components</span>. I use mainly JavaScript for front-end
  and have some knowledge of Node.Js for back-end and MongoDB.
</div>
<div class=styledP>
  I design and create, modern looking websites and web applications with
  functionality including <span class="bold">APIs</span>. I use <span class="bold">Figma</span> to
  design a modern looking layout with the use of number of popular
  design patterns. Currently, most of the internet users browse Web on
  mobile devices therefor <span class="bold">RWD</span> is quite important that is
  why I am implementing it in my websites and applications.
</div>
<div class=styledP>
  I use <span class="bold">React</span> which requires good knowledge of number of
  technologies like <span class="bold">JavaScript ES6</span>, HTML, CSS, Package
  Manager, WebPack, Babel and many more. Most of my work is kept via Git
  CLI on <span class="bold">GitHub</span> so I branch, commit, push, pull and merge
  fairly often.
</div>
<div class=styledP>
  All my work is done on <span class="bold">Linux</span> machine so Terminal is used
  on a regular basis. Code editor of my choice is
  <span class="bold">Visual Studio Code</span>. Also I know how to build a backend
  for simple communication(express.js) with frontend(Axios) and
  database.
