  <p class=styledP>
  I am a <span class="bold">React</span> developer from Reading, UK.
  I create React web apps based on components styled with <span class="bold">styled-components</span>.
  I mainly use JavaScript for front-end development and have some knowledge
  of Node.js for back-end development and <span class="bold">MongoDB</span> as document database.
</p>
<p class=styledP>
I design and create modern-looking websites and web applications with functionality,
including <span class="bold">APIs</span>. I use <span class="bold">Figma</span> to design modern layouts utilizing various popular design patterns.
Since most internet users browse the web on mobile devices, responsive web design (RWD) is quite important.
Therefore, I implement <span class="bold">RWD</span> in my websites and applications.
</p>
<p class=styledP>
I use <span class="bold">React</span>, which requires a good knowledge of several technologies like <span class="bold">JavaScript ES6</span>, HTML, CSS, package managers, Webpack, Babel, and many more. Most of my work is managed via Git CLI on <span class="bold">GitHub</span>, so I branch, commit, push, pull, and merge fairly often.

</p>
<p class=styledP>
My work is done on a <span class="bold">Macbook, Windows, Linux</span> machine. My code editor of choice is<span class="bold">Visual Studio Code</span>. Additionally, I know how to build a back end for simple communication (Express.js) with the front end (Axios) and the database.
