# Work Tracker

## Brief description

This application is mainly created to track hours and to help calculate income\
earned at work where different rates apply depending on the day of the week and time of the day.\
It is also created to practice full stack development including frontend,\
user interface created in React, and backend build in Node.js.\
At the moment Iâ€™m not entirely sure which DB I will use for this project but\
probably it will be either Mongo DB or MySQL.

### FrontEnd 

#### ToDo

- [x] calendar tab
- [ ] calendar to specify days off
        This calendar needs to specify days off and then on save create year with earnings. It should\
        be saved in the list of rotas:

        This component needs to have lis:
            - Year rota.

            - Edit button.
- [ ] component to select same repeated days in the week
