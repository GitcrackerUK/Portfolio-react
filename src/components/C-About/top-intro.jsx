                <StP>
                    My name is <Bold>Pawel</Bold>, I am a self-thought and motivated programmer from Reading, UK. <br />
                    I started programming without any prior knowledge back in 2018 and now I'm proficient <Bold>React Developer</Bold>.</StP>
                <StP>
                    I design and create, modern looking websites and web applications with functionality including <Bold>API</Bold>. I use <Bold>Figma</Bold> to helps me with design of modern looking layouts with the use of number of popular design patterns. Currently, most of the internet users browse Web on mobile devices therefor <Bold>RWD</Bold> is quite important that is why I am implementing it in my websites and applications.

                <StP>
                    I currently use  <Bold>React</Bold> which requires good knowledge of number of technologies like <Bold>JavaScript ES6</Bold>, HTML, CSS, Package Manager,  WebPack, Babel and many more. Most of my work is kept via Git CLI on <Bold>GitHub</Bold> so I branch, commit, push, pull and merge fairly often. </StP>
                <StP>
                    All my work is done on <Bold>Linux</Bold> machine so Terminal is used on a regular basis. Code editor of my choice is <Bold>Visual Studio Code</Bold>. Also I know how to build a backend for simple communication(express.js) with frontend(Axios) and database. <br />
                    The next step for me will be <Bold>MERN</Bold> stack which I am planning to master in the nearest future.
